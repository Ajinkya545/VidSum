# Video Summarization Using Attention Mechanisms

This project implements a video summarization system utilizing attention mechanisms to extract the most informative segments from videos. The system leverages the SUMME and TVSum datasets for training and evaluation, and uses the Inception V3 model for feature extraction. By applying advanced attention techniques, the system identifies key moments in videos, providing concise and relevant summaries while reducing the overall length.

## Features
- **Datasets**: Trained and evaluated using the SUMME and TVSum datasets
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Inception V3 for extracting visual features
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Highlights essential segments based on attention models
- **Summarization**: Generates concise video summaries retaining key information
